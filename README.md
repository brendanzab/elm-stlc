# elm-stlc

A type checker for the simply typed lambda calculus, implemented in a
bidirectional style.

The point of this is to show that type checking is actually quite simple if
you follow a bidirectional approach! Hopefully this whets your appetite for
playing around with your own type checkers!

## Running the app

To play with this, install Elm 0.19, clone the repository, and run the Elm
Reactor:

```
elm reactor
```

Then open `src/Main.elm` in the file navigator
